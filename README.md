# Database Migrations with Alembic

This guide explains how to manage database migrations using Alembic in a Python project.

## Creating a Migration

To generate a new migration based on the changes in your models, run:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Your migration message"
```

This will create a new migration script in the `alembic/versions` directory.

## Applying Migrations

To apply all pending migrations and bring your database schema up to date, run:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

## Rolling Back a Migration

To revert the last migration, use:

```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```

Or specify a particular revision:

```bash
alembic downgrade <revision_id>
```

## Checking Current Migration Status

To see the current state of the migrations, run:

```bash
alembic current
```

## Viewing Migration History

To check the migration history:

```bash
alembic history
```
